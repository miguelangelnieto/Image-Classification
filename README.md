# Image Classification

Part of the [**Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.**](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was preprocessed, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.
